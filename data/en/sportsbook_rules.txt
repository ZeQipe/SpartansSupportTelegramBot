Asian Handicap
1. Basic Concept: Asian handicap betting aims to level the playing field between two teams by giving one team a hypothetical advantage or disadvantage before the game starts. This is done by applying a handicap to the final result of the match.
2. Handicap Values: Asian handicap bets typically involve quarter goals (0/+0.5. 0/-0.5), whole goals (+1, -1), and half goals. For example, a team might have a handicap of -0.5, -1.0, -1.5, etc., which means they need to win by a certain margin for the bet to win. Conversely, a team might have a handicap of +0.5, +1.0, +1.5, etc., which means they can lose by a certain margin or even draw for the bet to win.
3. Outcome Scenarios:
Win: If you bet on a team with a negative handicap and they win by more than the handicap value, your bet wins. Likewise, if you bet on a team with a positive handicap and they win, draw, or lose by less than the handicap value, your bet wins.
Loss: If you bet on a team with a negative handicap and they draw or lose, your bet loses. Similarly, if you bet on a team with a positive handicap and they lose by more than the handicap value, your bet loses.
Push: If the actual result matches the handicap exactly, your stake is refunded.
Half won: This outcome occurs when you place a handicap bet, and half of your bet is deemed a winner. Possible with quarter handicaps
Half lost: Is the outcome where only half of your bet is lost. Possible with quarter handicaps
4. Examples and Settlement rules for quarter, half and whole goals handicap markets Quarter Handicap:
If you bet on the favorite (e.g., Team A -0.25): If Team A wins, you win the full amount of your bet.
If the match ends in a draw, you'll get half of your stake back, and the other half will be considered a loss.
If Team A loses, you lose the entire bet.
If you bet on the underdog (e.g., Team B +0.25):
If Team B wins or the match ends in a draw, you win the full amount of your bet. If Team B loses, you lose the entire bet. Half Handicap:
If you bet on the favorite (e.g., Team A -0.5): Team A must win for you to win the bet.
If the match ends in a draw or Team A loses, you lose the bet. If you bet on the underdog (e.g., Team B +0.5):
Team B must either win or draw for you to win the bet. If Team B loses, you lose the bet.

Whole Handicap
Settlement for whole handicaps is simpler: If you bet on the favorite (e.g., Team A -1):
Team A must win by more than one goal for you to win the bet. If Team A wins by exactly one goal, it's a push (your stake is refunded). If Team A draws or loses, you lose the bet.
If you bet on the underdog (e.g., Team B +1):
Team B must either win or draw, or lose by less than one goal for you to win the bet.
If Team B loses by exactly one goal, it's a push (your stake is refunded). If Team B loses by more than one goal, you lose the bet
1. Benefits: Asian handicap betting eliminates the possibility of a draw outcome, providing more betting options and potentially higher winning probabilities.
2. If Asian Handicap bets are placed In-Play, goals that have been awarded prior to bet placement are discounted for settlement purposes. The scoreline is treated as 0-0 at the time of bet placement
